# standing-fit

A project for standing desks, to provide users data of when they've been sat too long.

The aim is to build:

- The most simple solution that can be used across many desk types with the least effort (no need for screws, bolts).

Experiments:

- Barometer: Can detect changes in altitude, however for small changes nothing is detected. Where it may not work for all users.
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor: TBC
- Hall Effect Sensor with Magnet: TBC
- Infrared Distance Sensor: TBC

Contributions welcome.
